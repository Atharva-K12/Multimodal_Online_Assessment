Aprroach 1: Fixed Size Clusters

Question Bank
    [
        id
        question
        answer
        vector
    ]

cluster
    [
        id
        question id question_list
        median 0th index question
    ]


Approach 2: Using K-Means

Question Bank
    [
        id
        question
        answer
        vector
        [
            id of closest question
        ]
    ]


Approach 3: THINK

Points to consider
1) If threshold is small, cluster size will be small and one question can be present in multiple clusters
    for an answer, check distance of median for clusters on which question is present -> based on distance select a cluster and return next question from that cluster.0th

2) Next question difficulty will be measured by closeness of answer.
